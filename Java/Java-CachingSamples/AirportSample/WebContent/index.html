  <h2>BlueMix Airport</h2>
  <p>The Airport sample is provided as an introduction to IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service functionality 
	 on BlueMix.  It runs simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functions to IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session 
	 Cache service in milliseconds.  The sample shows how large amounts of data (in this case, information about thousands of airports worldwide) 
	 can be stored using IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service on BlueMix.  When using the sample, 
	 the time taken to complete any CRUD operation is displayed, demonstrating the speed of accessing the grid.</p>
  <br/> 	 
  <h3>If this is the first time the sample application is accessed, it will pre-load data cache with 
  	  airport information.  It may take a few seconds.  Please wait......</h3>

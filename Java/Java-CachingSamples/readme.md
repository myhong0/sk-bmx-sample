## IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service samples

These are sample apps that show using of the IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service.

WebSphere Extreme Scale APIs are used to interact with data cache.

### AirportSample

The Airport sample is provided as an introduction to IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service functionality 
on BlueMix.  It runs simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functions to IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session 
Cache service in milliseconds.  The sample shows how large amounts of data (in this case, information about thousands of airports worldwide) 
can be stored using IBM Data Cache service and IBM Session Cache service on BlueMix.
